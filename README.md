## Ethical Considerations

In our study, we prioritized ethical responsibility, especially with regard to privacy and data protection.  
- User handles and video IDs were retained solely for quality control (e.g., verifying data accuracy).  
- We did **not** attempt to deanonymize users or access any non-public information.  
- Due to the potential for misuse and the impossibility of full anonymization, the **full dataset is not publicly available**.  
- We release **sample data** and **code** to support **methodological transparency** while safeguarding the privacy and safety of LGBTQ communities.
